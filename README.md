The dataset contains information on 1972 auctions that transacted on eBay.com during Mayâ€“June 2004. The goal is to use data to build a model that will classify auctions as competitive or non-competitive. A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least two bids placed on the item auctioned. The data include variables that describe the item (auction category), the seller (their eBay rating), and the auction terms that the seller selected (auction duration, opening price, currency, day-of-week of auction close).
